Vinho Verde refers to Portuguese wine that originated in the historic Minho province in the far north of the country.
 The data was collected from May 2004 to Feb 2007 using only protected designation of origin samples tested by the official certification entity (CVRVV). 
 
There are two datasets are available: 
1. Red Wine 
2. White Wine

I have used multiple linear regression algorithm for evaluating the quality of White Wine.
 Where Input variables(based on physicochemical tests) are Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, alcohol. And output variable (Based on sensory data) Quality, with a score between 0 to 10
